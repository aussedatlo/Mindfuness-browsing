# Mindfulness Browsing

## Project Description

### What does this do ?
We are all driven by our habits, good ones and unfortunatly bad ones. For me, some are so ingrained that I am aware of them when it's too late:
When bored on my computer, I will go on YouTube, Reddit or any trending social media for hours, to satisfy my boredom.
What if I could alert my conscious self that my unconscious self is accessing a problematic website?

When opening a problematic website for the time in this session, the extension will add an overlay on top of it for few seconds, making you aware of the action.

### Why should I use it ?
This project is to help you regain at least some control over your internet usage.
If you want to control your unconscious self when it comes to binge browsing and limit it to suit your needs, this extension is for you.
